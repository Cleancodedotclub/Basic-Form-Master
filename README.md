The "React JS Basic Form Master" is a simple project built with ReactJS that demonstrates how to create a basic form in a React application. The project includes a basic HTML form that allows the user to enter their name, email address, and a message. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to a server and the user receives a confirmation message.

The project is organized into several React components, including a Form component that renders the HTML form, an Input component that handles the input fields, and a Button component that handles the form submission. The project also includes a server component that receives the form data and sends a confirmation message.

The code is written in JSX syntax and uses React hooks to manage the state of the form data. The project demonstrates how to handle form validation and error handling using React hooks and how to use Axios to make HTTP requests to the server.
